# PKI Watcher

**Warning**: This library is in an early stage and might have multiple issues. Use with caution.

## Overview

PKI Watcher is a library designed to retrieve and monitor Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) data from various sources, such as Kubernetes, files, or SPIFFE. It supports gracefully reloading PKI using streams, ensuring your application remains secure and up-to-date.

## Features

- **Source Support**: Retrieve PKI data from multiple sources:
    - Kubernetes
    - Files ðŸš§
    - SPIFFE ðŸš§
- **Graceful Reloading**: Seamlessly reload PKI data using streams.
- **PKI Data Parsing**: Parse PKI data in PEM format with DER encoding, supporting the following formats:
    - PKCS#1
    - PKCS#2
    - PKCS#3
    - PKCS#8
- **Identity Creation**: Automatically parse PKI data to create identities that include:
    - Certificate
    - Corresponding private key (RSA or EC)
    - Server name (DNS or IP address)
    - Intermediate certificate
    - CA certificate
